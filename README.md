### Neural network training library written in C#

### Features:
 * GPU acceleration (using OpenCL)
 * Cost functions: Mean-Squared, Cross-entropy
 * Optional L1 and L2 regularization
 * Optimized weight and bias initialization
 * Stochastic gradient descent with shuffled mini-batches


### TODO:
 * Code refactor and cleanup
 * New features: Dropout, Softmax layers
 * Convolutional layer
 * LSTM networks
